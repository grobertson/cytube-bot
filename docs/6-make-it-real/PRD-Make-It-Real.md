# Sprint 6: Make It Real - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

**Sprint Name**: Make It Real  
**Sprint Goal**: Deploy infrastructure to actual servers and validate in real production environments  
**Status**: Planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-12  

## Context

Sprint 5 "Ship It!" delivered a complete CI/CD pipeline with all infrastructure components:
- Deployment workflows (test and production)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus + Alertmanager)
- Status dashboard
- Verification scripts
- systemd services
- Documentation

However, all of this infrastructure is theoretical or stubbed:
- Workflows have echo commands instead of actual SSH deployments
- No actual servers provisioned
- GitHub Secrets not configured
- Health endpoint not implemented
- No real-world validation

**Sprint 6 takes this infrastructure and makes it real** by deploying to actual servers, configuring real secrets, implementing missing dependencies, and validating everything works in production.

## Problem Statement

The CI/CD pipeline built in Sprint 5 is complete but untested in real environments:

1. **Stubbed Deployments**: Workflows simulate deployment with echo commands
2. **Missing Health Endpoint**: Verification scripts, monitoring, and dashboard all expect `/api/health` but it doesn't exist
3. **No Server Configuration**: No actual servers provisioned or configured
4. **Unconfigured Secrets**: GitHub Secrets needed for SSH deployment not set up
5. **Untested in Production**: No validation that infrastructure works with real traffic
6. **Missing Operational Experience**: No real-world deployment experience to refine procedures

## Success Criteria

Sprint 6 is successful when:

1. ✅ Bot deployed and running on actual test server
2. ✅ Bot deployed and running on actual production server
3. ✅ Health endpoint implemented and returning valid data
4. ✅ Monitoring stack collecting real metrics
5. ✅ Dashboard displaying real bot status
6. ✅ Alerts firing and delivering to notification channels
7. ✅ Rollback procedure tested and validated
8. ✅ Bot handling production traffic successfully
9. ✅ Documentation updated with real-world findings
10. ✅ Operational confidence in deployment pipeline

## Dependencies & Blockers

## Technical Architecture

### Deployment Flow
```
GitHub Actions Workflow
         ↓
   SSH to Server
         ↓
   rsync/scp files
         ↓
   systemctl restart services
         ↓
   Run verification scripts
         ↓
   Report status
```

### Production Architecture
```
Bot Process (systemd)
   ↓ (metrics via health endpoint)
Prometheus (systemd)
   ↓ (alert rules)
Alertmanager (systemd)
   ↓ (notifications)
Webhook/Email/Slack

Dashboard (systemd)
   ↓ (reads health endpoint)
Web Browser
```

### Health Endpoint
```python
# GET /api/health
{
  "status": "connected",
  "connected": true,
  "channel": "RoseyRoom",
  "uptime": 86400,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "user_count": 42,
  "requests": 1234,
  "errors": 5
}
```

## Risk Analysis

### High Risk
1. **Server Access Issues**
   - Risk: Can't access servers via SSH
   - Mitigation: Test SSH access before deployment, have backup access methods

2. **Health Endpoint Performance**
   - Risk: Endpoint impacts bot performance
   - Mitigation: Run on separate thread, implement async properly

3. **Production Bot Credentials**
   - Risk: Invalid credentials block production deployment
   - Mitigation: Test credentials in test environment first

### Medium Risk
1. **SSH Deployment Complexity**
   - Risk: SSH commands fail in CI environment
   - Mitigation: Test SSH commands manually first, add proper error handling

2. **Network Configuration**
   - Risk: Firewall blocks monitoring or health endpoints
   - Mitigation: Document and test all required ports

3. **Service Dependencies**
   - Risk: Services fail to start due to missing dependencies
   - Mitigation: Document all dependencies, test service startup

### Low Risk
1. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Risk: Missing real-world details in docs
   - Mitigation: Update docs throughout sprint, not just at end

2. **Alert Tuning**
   - Risk: Too many or too few alerts
   - Mitigation: Start conservative, tune based on experience

## Validation Plan

### Per-Sortie Validation
Each sortie has acceptance criteria that must be met before proceeding.

### End-of-Sprint Validation

   - Bot running in production
   - All services operational
   - Monitoring collecting metrics
   - Alerts configured and tested

2. **Reliability Check**

   - No critical errors
   - Automated deployments working
   - Rollback tested and documented

3. **Operational Readiness**

   - Runbook created
   - Team trained on operations
   - Confidence in production deployment

## Success Metrics
